--model_path 'HuanjinYao/Mulberry_llava_8b' \
--question 'Question: <Your_Question>' \
--img_path '<Your_Img_Path>' \
--only_output_final_answer
```

</details>

## Data Constrution with CoMCTS
We release **CoMCTS Code** for generating reasoning and reflection data, which leverage collective knowledge from multiple models to collaboratively conjecture, search and identify effective reasoning paths toward correct answers via four iterative operations including Expansion, Simulation and Error Positioning, Backpropagation, and Selection.

Please refer [here](https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry/tree/main/comcts) for more details.

After searching, you can use the [code](https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry/blob/main/comcts/code/data_construction.py) we provide to construct reasoning and reflection data. `reflection_data_percentage` is used to control the proportion of reflection data.
```bash
python data_construction.py \
--models gpt-4o qwen2_vl_7b qwen2_vl_72b llama_vision_11b \
--output_path <Your_output_path>/mulberry_data.json \
--data_path <CoMCTS_search_data_path> \
--reflection_data_percentage 0.1 \
```

## Training
We use [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) to fine-tune the Mulberry models. We provide the training instructions and configs here.

First, install LLaMA-Factory according to the [official_instruction](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

Then, refer [here](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/main/data/README.md) and update the following customized dataset into `dataset_info.json` in LLaMA-Factory.
```bash
"mulberry": {
    "file_name": "./mulberry_sft.json",
    "formatting": "sharegpt",
    "columns": {
      "messages": "messages",
      "images": "images"
    },
    "tags": {
      "role_tag": "role",
      "content_tag": "content",
      "user_tag": "user",
      "assistant_tag": "assistant"
    }
  },
```

Finally, you can use the following command to train the models.
```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_full/mulberry_llava_8b_full_sft.yaml
```

## Evaluation
We use [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) to evaluate the Mulberry models on different benchmarks. We provide the evaluation instructions and key code here.

First, you need to install VLMEvalKit according to the [official instructions](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit/blob/main/docs/en/Quickstart.md) and replace [image_vqa.py](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit/blob/main/vlmeval/dataset/image_vqa.py#L44) with ours in [here](https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry/blob/main/evaluation/image_vqa.py).

Next, replace the `llava.py` file in `VLMEvalKit-main/vlmeval/vlm/llava/` with the `llava.py` file we provide [here](https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry/tree/main/evaluation).

Finally, you can use the following command to perform the evaluation.
```bash
python run.py --data MathVista_MINI --model llava_next_llama3 --verbose
```


## Main Results

We conduct extensive experiments with four powerful baseline models, including [LLaVA-Next-8b](https://huggingface.co/llava-hf/llama3-llava-next-8b-hf), [LLaMA-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct), [Qwen2-VL-2B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) and [Qwen2-VL-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct). The **Main Results** comparing the Mulberry models with other state-of-the-art models across several popular benchmarks are shown in the figure below.

## Limitations
Mulberry is a preliminary exploration work in o1-like MLLM, leveraging Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search to enable effective and efficient reasoning-path searching and learning. 
CoMCTS leverages collective knowledge to significantly improve the search success rate and efficiency of reasoning path searches.
By training on the reasoning data generated through CoMCTS, Mulberry has gained step-by-step reasoning capabilities, leading to a substantial improvement in overall performance.
Nevertheless, certain limitations must be acknowledged.

Hallucinations in intermediate steps: Hallucinations are still prevalent in MLLMs, whether in closed or open-source models.
For instance, the models may generate obvious errors in intermediate reasoning steps yet still arrive at the correct final answer in CoMCTS.
Therefore, although we incorporated multiple models to better detect errors, some errors still persist in the intermediate steps because ensuring the correctness of all intermediate steps often requires human checks, which is extremely costly and unaffordable for us.

Error localization: 
During our experiments, we observed that models struggle to detect their own errors. To address this, CoMCTS employs multiple models to cross-check each other's errors.
However, our findings also revealed that smaller models often fail to generate effective detection responses, while larger models occasionally exhibit inaccurate error localization.
Thus, inaccurate localization may impact the efficiency of the search and we recommend using larger models for error localization or exploring better prompts to enable smaller models to localize errors more accurately.

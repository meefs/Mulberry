Here, we provide detailed instructions for running CoMCTS, along with illustrative examples of its inputs and outputs.

You can try out CoMCTS reasoning with the data in the [demo_data](https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry/tree/main/comcts/demo_data) folder.

## Start Search

Our CoMCTS code now supports reasoning path search using [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), [LLaMA-3.2-Vision series](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/), and [Qwen-2-VL series](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2-VL) models. 

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7' python code/run_comcts.py \
    --image_dir_path ./demo_data/images \
    --data_path ./demo_data/comcts_input_data.json \
    --output_path ./output/comcts_data.jsonl \

```



## Input Data Examples

We provide several input samples in the [demo_data](https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry/tree/main/comcts/demo_data) folder, randomly selected from the [Geo3k](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.528.pdf) dataset.


`"image"`: `"image"` is either the absolute path to the image or a path relative to `image_dir_path`.

`"question"`: We recommend extracting the question into the `"question"` first, as the questions in the conversations may include prompts that could affect reasoning searches and influence the results (e.g., phrases like "directly select the answer").

`"conversations"`: We limit the length of `"conversations"` to 2, consisting of one question from the **human** and one response from **GPT**. **GPT's response** is used as the **ground truth** to evaluate whether the reasoning path successfully finds the correct answer.

You need to organize your custom input data following the format below:

```bash
{
    "image": "geo3k/train/74/img_diagram.png",
    "question": "Question: Find x.\nChoices:\nA: 30\nB: 45\nC: 60\nD: 90",
    "conversations": [
        {
            "from": "human",
            "value": "<image>\nBased on the image, directly select the correct answer for the following question:\nQuestion: Find x.\nChoices:\nA: 30\nB: 45\nC: 60\nD: 90"
        },
        {
            "from": "gpt",
            "value": "Answer:B"
        }
    ]
}
```

Since lines a and b are parallel, and c is a transversal intersecting these lines, angle 4 and angle 5 are consecutive interior angles.\n\n### Step 2:\nUse the consecutive interior angles theorem. For two parallel lines cut by a transversal, the sum of consecutive interior angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, m\u22204 + m\u22205 = 180\u00b0.\n\n### Step 3:\nSubstitute the given value for m\u22204 into the equation from Step 2. We have m\u22204 = 57\u00b0.\n\n### Step 4:\nCalculate m\u22205 using the equation m\u22204 + m\u22205 = 180\u00b0. Substitute 57 for m\u22204 and solve for m\u22205: 57\u00b0 + m\u22205 = 180\u00b0.\n\n### Step 5:\nSubtract 57\u00b0 from both sides to find m\u22205: m\u22205 = 180\u00b0 - 57\u00b0.\n\n### Step 6:\nCalculate the final value: m\u22205 = 123\u00b0.\n\n### The final answer is: C",

Therefore, the measure of angle 1 is equal to the measure of the corresponding angle on line 'b', which is also 32\u00b0.\n\nSince the line from point A to point C is perpendicular to line 'b', the angle at A with line 'b' (angle 2) and the angle at A with the perpendicular line are complementary angles. The sum of the measures of two complementary angles is always 90\u00b0.\n\n### Step 1:\nThe sum of the measures of two complementary angles is 90\u00b0. Let's denote the measure of angle 2 as x. Therefore, 32\u00b0 + x = 90\u00b0.\n\n### Step 2:\nSolving for x, we get x = 90\u00b0 - 32\u00b0 = 58\u00b0.\n\n### The final answer is:: 58\u00b0"

### Output Example #4


To enable faster reasoning on relatively simple problems, you can use a smaller ensemble of models for search (e.g., GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL-7B), as the 72B model has a slower inference speed.

**Output example #4** demonstrates that smaller models can deduce the correct answer while **GPT-4o makes errors**. This highlights the importance of collective knowledge in reasoning and search, showing that leveraging collective insights can imporve the search success rate.
